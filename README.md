This small tool converts a Word document (.docx or .doc) containing embedded Visio images (.vsdx or .vsd) into one with embedded TIFF images, which are also saved to a specified folder. Additionally, it can convert multi-page Visio files into separate TIFF images.

It significantly reduces the manual effort required, especially when converting a large number of Visio images to bitmap images.

The tool allows users to select different DPI settings, while other parameters are fixed based on my experience to ensure optimal performance.

The tool is developed in Python 3 using PySide6, and the source code files, along with the executable file, are provided here.
