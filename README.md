# visio2tiff

This tool converts Word documents (.docx or .doc) containing embedded Visio images into ones with embedded TIFF images. At the same time, the converted TIFF images are saved to a specified folder. In addition, it can convert multi-page Visio files into separate TIFF images.

It significantly reduces the manual effort required, especially when dealing with a large number of images.

The tool allows users to select different DPI settings, while other parameters are fixed based on my experience to ensure optimal performance.
